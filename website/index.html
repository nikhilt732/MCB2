    <h2>Formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      Formal education or formal learning usually takes place in the premises of school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school.
      Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. It is associated with a specific or stage and is provided under the certain set of rules and regulations.

    <h2>Informal Education</h2>
    <p>
      People can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library or educational websites.
      Informal education is when you are not studying in a school and do not use any particular learning method. In this type of education, conscious efforts are not involved. It is neither pre-planned nor deliberate. It may be learned at some marketplace, hotel or at home.
      Unlike formal education, informal education is not imparted by an institution such as school or college. Informal education is not given according to any fixed timetable. There is no set curriculum required. Informal education consists of experiences and actually living in the family or community.

    <h2>NON-Formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      In nonformal education, someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills.
      Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning), distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities. 
      Non-formal education is imparted consciously and deliberately and systematically implemented. It should be organized for a homogeneous group. Non-formal, education should be programmed to serve the needs of the identified group. This will necessitate flexibility in the design of the curriculum and the scheme of evaluation.
